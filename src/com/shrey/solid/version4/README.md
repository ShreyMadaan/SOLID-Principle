# Version 4 – Applying Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

### ✅ What Changed:
We added `WhatsAppNotifier`, which **inherits behavior correctly** from the `Notifier` interface.

The `NotificationService` treats all notifiers interchangeably.

### ✅ LSP Applied:
- Subclasses can be substituted without breaking the system.
- New notifiers are truly **plug-and-play**.
- Polymorphism remains safe and predictable.

This version builds confidence in interface-based design.
